Semantic image editing provides users with a flexible tool to modify a given image guided by a corresponding segmentation map. In this task, the features of the foreground objects and the backgrounds are quite different. However, all previous methods handle backgrounds and objects as a whole using a monolithic model. Consequently, they remain limited in processing content-rich images and suffer from generating unrealistic objects and
texture-inconsistent backgrounds. To address this issue, we propose a novel paradigm, **S**emantic **I**mage **E**diting by **D**isentangling **O**bject and **B**ackground (**SIEDOB**), the core idea of which is to explicitly leverages several heterogeneous subnetworks for objects and backgrounds.
